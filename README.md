# MySQL Materialized Views
This project is a small collection of SQL code for creating materialized views in MySQL &amp; MariaDB

You create database views for convenience and for performance. When view performance is not enough the next step is creating materialized views.

There are no materialized views in MySQL, but there are ways to achieve the same results in MySQL and MariaDB.

There are actually 3 methods in which you can create materialized views in MySQL. Check out my detailed post on creating [MySQL materialized views](http://www.coding-dude.com/wp/databases/creating-mysql-materialized-views/):

- Method 1 – Create a MySQL materialized view – example using triggers
- Method 2 – MySQL materialized views using MySQL scheduled events
